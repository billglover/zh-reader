# 🇨🇳 Chinese Reader

Build your confidence reading Chinese

Chinese Reader gets you started with reading Chinese in the wild. By highlighting known characters Chinese Reader makes it easy to spot text you'll be able to read.

## 💡 How it began

My efforts to learn Chinese have focused on the spoken language. This has allowed me to make limited progress, but on several occasions I've found my inability to read or even recognise characters to be a real barrier. Without the ability to read, I feel unable to take advantage of the incredible language learning opportunities afforded by the digital world in which we spend much of our time.

As I slowly increase my vocabulary I find myself put off reading when faced with reading Chinese text. Character recall can be slow and variations in font or style can lead to frustrating mistakes. At the heart of this frustration though is the challenge faced when I don't recognise a character:  Is it that I've never seen it before, do I simply just not remember it?

I began work on a Chinese Reader...
